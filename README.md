# DailyIowan-TextAnalytics
Group collaboration to run text analytics techniques on articles from the newspaper "The Daily Iowan". 

## Web Scraping
Performed by Conlan Green. In the Web Scrape file I used the library Beautiful soup to loop through the first 200 main news pages on the website [The Daily Iowan]["https://dailyiowan.com/category/news/"]. The HTML files are included in the repository. Using the same library I parsed the author name, article title, date and time of publishing and the article text and created a dataframe that I later converted to a csv file.

## Topic Analysis

## Final Conclusions



# Instructions/ Needed Files
The necessary data to run the analysis is included in "ArticleText.csv" which will be uploaded with the final project.
