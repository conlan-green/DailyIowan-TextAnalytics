# DailyIowan-TextAnalytics
Group collaboration to run text analytics techniques on articles from the newspaper "The Daily Iowan". As a group we will acquire 2000 articles from the site, use sentiment analysis, topic modeling and clustering to gain insights to the paper as a whole.

### Web Scraping
Performed by Conlan Green. In the Web Scrape file I used the library Beautiful soup to loop through the first 200 main news pages on the website [The Daily Iowan]["https://dailyiowan.com/category/news/"]. The HTML files are included in the repository. Using the same library I parsed the author name, article title, date and time of publishing and the article text and created a dataframe that I later converted to a csv file.

### Topic Analysis 

### Sentiment Analysis
