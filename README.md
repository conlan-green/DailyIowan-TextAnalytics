# Description 
Group collaboration to run text analytics techniques on articles from the newspaper "The Daily Iowan". As a group we will acquire 2000 articles from the site, use sentiment analysis, topic modeling and clustering to gain insights to the newspaper as a whole.

#### Web Scraping
Performed by Conlan Green. In the Web Scrape file I used the library Beautiful soup to loop through the first 200 main news pages on the website [The Daily Iowan]["https://dailyiowan.com/category/news/"]. The HTML files are included in the repository. Using the same library I parsed the author name, article title, date and time of publishing and the article text and created a dataframe that I later converted to a csv file.

#### Topic Analysis 

#### Sentiment Analysis 
Performed by Daniel Dai

#### Final Conclusions



# Instructions/ Needed Files
The necessary data to run the analysis is included in "ArticleText.csv" which will be uploaded with the final project. You may run Web Scrape if you would like the html files as well but it takes a large amount of time due to built in sleep function in order to be respectful to the website
